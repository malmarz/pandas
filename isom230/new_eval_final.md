# Updated Final Project Grading Criteria

The biggest change is the final deliverable. **You are no longer required to submit a menu based applicaition on repl.it**.

The replit application is optional and if you do submit it will count towards the bonus for the project.

## What to submit and how?

Submit the jupyter notebook and data files you collected and cleaned using moodle. More instructions available there.

## Grading

- Phase 2 and phase 3 grading will remain the same. You must schedule meetings otherwise you will not receive their grades.
  - Note: Phase 2 grade already set, you can make it up through bonus work.
- For the analysis notebook, you must show enough work in data collection and analysis to justify your grade. See options 1 to 3 to see the type and amount of analysis expected of you.
- Additional analysis that you perform will either replace missing analysis or be award you bonus credits.
- Since you are no longer required to submit an application, you must organize your notebook to be readable. Make sure each cell has comments that clearly explain what you are doing.
- Due date has been extended to Wednesday March 3rd
  - Later submissions will be accepted until the end of March 9th, with a deduction of 2% for every day after the due date.
