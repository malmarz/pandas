# Final Project - Country Data (Option 3)

## Overview

A [data set](final_project_data.csv) has been prepared for you. You are  required to build an application to show the data for specific countries and show some analysis.

## Requirements

- Load the [provided data](final_project_data.csv) automatically into the application upon start.
- Build a menu application based on the provided data that provides the following features
  - List all countries available in the dataset.
  - Allow user to view report on a specific country, the country is chosen by inputting the country name or number. Report should include maximum, minimum, mean, and std for at least 5 variables for that county's data over the years.
  - For that country, show at least 5 appropriate plots for 5 different variables for that country. For example, showing GDP over time or showing box plot or histogram to show distribution of change in inflation rate.
  - Find the top ten country list for 5 different variables (show most and least)
  - Plot 5 different plots to compare 2 countries on different variables. The user should be able to set the 2 countries to compare
  - For a specific year chosen by the user, calculate the maximum, minimum, average, and standard deviation for 5 different variable for all countries in your data set.

## Grading

- Grade for current requirements is 75% only of total grade for the project. You must find ways to improve the project to get the full 100%. Focus on learning something new about Python.
- You can attempt to complete some of the bonus requirements or suggest your own improvement to reach the 100% grade.
- You are required to meet at least once with your instructor to receive the grades for phase 3 of your project.
  - Request the meeting when you perform most of the analysis
  - In the final project you will demonstrate the application that will display your findings on the last week of classes.
  - Failure to meet with your instructor will result in not accepting your project submission for grading.
- Building the application is a requirement for this option and a demonstration based on a pandas report is not acceptable.
