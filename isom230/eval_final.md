# Final Project Evaluation Criteria

## Phase 1

Quiz 7 Grade is set for the proposal, total is 50 pts.

Deductions to the grade based on the following:

- Insufficient or unclear data analysis or features.
- Projects challenge is not clearly appropriate for the final.

## Phase 2

Failure to meet the following requirements will result in point deductions from the total 50 pts:

- Appropriately combining the data into a single dataframe.
- Appropriately storing the dataframe as a files in either csv, json, or excel format.
- Answering questions during the meeting, which will include:
    - Questions about the tasks that you performed.
    - Questions about the next phase, what analysis will be completed.
- Bonus could be awarded for the extra tasks or new things you learn and implement. But you have to demonstrate it to your instructor and be prepared for questions.
- You will receive comments from your instructor to improve the application

## Phase 3

Failure to meet the following requirements will result in point deductions from the total 50 pts:

- Setting up a timely meeting with the instructor to review
- Showing that all the analysis has been completed and can be demonstrated on jupyter notebook
- Showing an initial implementation of a menu based application (hosted on replit) that lists the available options
- Implementing a single analysis on the menu based application that uses the file stored from phase 2.
- Answering questions during the meeting, which will include:
    - Questions about the tasks that you performed.
    - Questions about the next phase.
- Bonus could be awarded for the extra tasks or new things you learn and implement. But you have to demonstrate it to your instructor and be prepared for questions.
- You will receive comments from your instructor to improve the application

## Final Demo

You will get 15-20 minutes to demo your application in class. The demo will be split into two main parts:
- The demonstration (50% of grade):
    
    - Describe briefly what your application is about (Which general question is helps you answer)
    - Demonstrate 3 different features (focus on the added features that will give you bonus)
    - You must complete the demo in less than 10 minutes otherwise your demo will be cut short for Q&A
    - Grading is based how well you perform these tasks and complete instructions given to you by your instructor from previous phases. 

- The Q&A (50% of grade)
    
    - Then the instructor will ask you to perform 3 different tasks with your application
    - Finally you will be asked a few questions about how things work and to explain some of the coding.
    - Grading will be based on how well your application performs the tasks from the instructor and your responses to his questions.
