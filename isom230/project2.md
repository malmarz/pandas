# Final Project - World Bank Data Analysis (Option 2)

## Overview

You are required to fetch world bank data on a specific topic and combine the data into a single data frame. You are then required to build an application to show the data for specific countries and show some analysis.

## Requirements

- Choose one of the topics from the [World Bank Indicators](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator) then download 5 different data files for indicators that you find interesting.
- Using python, combine the data into a single dataframe and store it on your file system. You will use this combined file for all your analysis and building your application.
- Build a menu application that provides the following features
  - List all countries available in the dataset and their short code (for example, KW: Kuwait)
  - Allow user to view report on a specific country, the country is chosen by inputting the country short code. Report should include maximum, minimum, mean, and std for at least 5 variables for that county's data over the years.
  - For that country, show at least 5 appropriate plots for 5 different variables for that country. For example, showing GDP over time or showing box plot or histogram to show distribution of change in inflation rate.
  - Find the top ten country list for 5 different variables (show most and least)
  - Plot 5 different plots to compare 2 countries on different variables. The user should be able to set the 2 countries to compare
  - For a specific year chosen by the user, calculate the maximum, minimum, average, and standard deviation for 5 different variable all countries in your data set.

## Grading

- Grade for current requirements is 85% only of total grade for the project. You must find ways to improve the project to get the full 100%. Focus on learning something new about Python.
- You can attempt to complete some of the bonus requirements or suggest your own improvement to reach the 100% grade.
- You are required to meet at least twice with your instructor to receive the grades for phase 2 and phase 3 of your project.
  - Request a meeting once you collect your data
  - Request the other meeting when you perform most of the analysis
  - In the final project you will demonstrate the application that will display your findings on the last week of classes.
- Building the application is a requirement for this option and a demonstration based on a pandas report is not acceptable.
